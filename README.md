## Development

First of all run ```bundle``` to install gem

Now you can call it in console, for example
 ```
cuteToast({
	type:  'success', 
	title:  "Great",
	message:  "Product was successfully added",
	timer:  5000
	})
```

and you'll see little alert, if all works well

You can call it everywhere you want

Also a good practice will be use Stimulus controller (if you use stimulus) to call this alerts:
1. Generate controlller:
```
rails g stimulus cutealert
```
2. add some code you want to controller:
```
# app/javascript/controllers/cutealert_controller.js

import  {  Controller  }  from  "@hotwired/stimulus"
// Connects to data-controller="cutealert"
export  default  class  extends  Controller  {
	static  targets  = ["input"]

	connect()  {
	}

	successToast()  {
		cuteToast({
		type:  'success',
		title:  "Great",
		message:  "Product was successfully added",
		timer:  50000000000
		})
	}
}
``` 
3. Add this to youe button:
```
<div  data-controller="cutealert">
	<%=  form_with  url:  add_product_in_cart_path(product)  do  |f|  %>
	...
		<%=  f.submit  "Add to cart", class:  "btn-black", data:  {
                                                            cutealert_target:  "input",
                                                            action:  "click->cutealert#successToast",
                                                            turbo:  false }  %>
	<%  end  %>
</div>
